# Computer Lab Issue Notify System

This project is a web-based system to help manage and solve problems in a computer lab.

## What does it do?

- It lets lab assistants, teachers, and admins report and track issues in computer labs.
- Users can log in with their email and password.
- Lab problems (like broken computers or software issues) can be posted, viewed, and managed.
- Lab assistants can see all the problems, update their statuses (like "solved" or "not solved"), and keep notes about how issues were fixed.
- The system sends notifications via E-mail to the right people (for example, to the lab assistant when there is a new or solved problem).

## Why is it useful?

- It helps keep the computer lab running smoothly.
- Makes sure problems are not forgotten.
- Everyone can see which issues are still open and which are fixed.
- Makes lab management easier and more organized.

## Who uses it?
